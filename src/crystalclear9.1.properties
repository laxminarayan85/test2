# if it will execute all reports.
# If load_balancing_enabled is false, the cache will send a request to the other cluster nodes,
# if another cluster node has already rendered the report and has the rendered report in its cache.
# If not, the report will be rendered on the local machine.
# The default value is true.
cluster.load_balancing_enabled=true

# Cluster Load Reduction
# This property reduces the number of reports this cluster node has to render
# compared to the number of reports other cluster nodes have to render.
# It is useful to set a value higher than 0 e.g. if this cluster node is a front-end computer and if it
# needs more performance for other tasks than other cluster nodes.
# The default value is 0.
cluster.load_reduction=0


# ***** Scheduler Web Configuration Tool Properties *****
# The Scheduler is available in i-net Crystal-Clear Plus, only.

# Enable/Disable the i-net SchedulerXML web configuration tool
# Specifies if the i-net SchedulerXML web configuration tool

# IP address filter for the i-net SchedulerXML web configuration tool
# Property to restrict the access of i-net SchedulerXML web configuration tool.
# Specifies the IP address(es) of the hosts that are authorized for access the
# i-net SchedulerXML web configuration tool.
# If the value is emtpy then there is no restriction, that means the

# machines that can access the host.
# The IP addresses can be specified as:
#     comma separated list of IP addresses that are authorized,
#     IP addresses that are not authorized and
#     ranges of IP addresses.
# If an IP address was set twice, authorized and not authorized, then the IP address
# is not authorized. The blocking of IP addresses has highest priority.
# The IP address can be set in IPv4 and IPv6 syntax, both in full form( x.x.x.x  , x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x)
# Samples:
# scheduler_config.addressfilter=127.0.0.1
#    ( only localhost is authorized to access )
# scheduler_config.addressfilter=127.0.0.1,210.0.0.0-210.256.256.256

# ***** Cache Properties *****
# The cache type property specifies which storage medium the cache will use to save the rendered reports.
# If Memory Cache is used, the data will not be stored permanently.
# With the Database Cache the data will be stored in a database and with
# the Harddisk Cache the data will be stored on the harddisk.
# For the External Database Cache it is necessary to set the
# connections with an external program.
# Possible values:
#    0=Memory Cache
#    1=Database Cache (available in i-net Crystal-Clear Plus, only)
#    2=Harddisk Cache (available in i-net Crystal-Clear Plus, only)
#    3=External Database Cache (available in i-net Crystal-Clear Plus, only)
cache.type=0

# ***** Harddisk Cache Properties *****
# Specifies the directory for saving the cached files to disk.
# The directory will be created if it does not exist.
cache.hd.root_directory=

# Number of subdirectories created for each report saved in the harddisk cache.
# If you change the value of this property then all data in the harddisk cache
# will be deleted.
# The default value is 0.
# 0: one subdirectory per report name (default)
# 1: one subdirectory per report and all parameters of the report
# 2: one subdirectory per report and one subdirectory for each parameter of the report
cache.hd.sub_directory=0

# ***** Database Cache Properties *****
# When using the Database Cache these properties are important and must be set.
# Specifies the fully qualified classname of the JDBC driver class used for the cache.
# e.g. com.inet.tds.TdsDriver
cache.db.driverclass=
# Specifies the JDBC url
# e.g. jdbc:inetdae7:srv:port

# Specifies the database user for the given database
cache.db.username=
# Specifies the password for the database user
cache.db.password=

# Cache Timeout
# This property specifies how long a report stays in the database or harddisk cache.
# The default value is 15 minutes, zero means unlimited.
EngineCacheTimeout=15

# Cachefilter enabled
# If this property is true, only reports can be requested from the report server that
# have been saved in the cache from the i-net SchedulerXML. That means the report must
# be a part of a scheduled task and this task must have the action "CacheAction" at least.
# This will prevent an report server that is used as scheduler server, only, from other report requests.
# Use this flag only in combination with Hard Disk Cache or Database Cache.
# The default value is false.
scheduler_cachefilter.enabled=false


# Specifies a comma separated list of additional services listening in i-net Crystal-Clear report server or servlet.
# These service classes must implement the class com.inet.report.RequestHandler.
# Per default the list of request handlers is empty.
# If database or hard disk cache is used the CacheRequestHandler can be used to view and/or delete reports stored in cache.
# The CacheRequestHandler can be started with "?init=cacheviewer" if it has been added to this list of RequestHandlers, e.g.:
# requesthandler=com.inet.report.cache.CacheRequestHandler
# The EMailRequestHandler can be started with "?init=email" if it has been added to this list of RequestHandlers, e.g.:
# requesthandler=com.inet.report.schedule.server.EMailRequestHandler
# requesthandler=com.inet.report.cache.CacheRequestHandler,com.inet.report.schedule.server.EMailRequestHandler,com.company.MyReportServerLogger
requesthandler=


# Specifies a class implementing the com.inet.report.PropertiesChecker interface which will be used
# for rendering the reports when you have a standalone server or a Windows service.
# This will not work for i-net Crystal-Clear running in an application server.
# Please also get sure that the jar-file containing this class is in the classpath of i-net Crystal-Clear.
PropertyChecker=


# Defines the prompt behavior, under which cases the prompt dialog is to be shown, depending on whether or not default values
# are to be viewed as set values.
# Possible values:
#  VALUES_MUST_BE_EXPLICITLY_SET: A prompt dialog is shown every time if and only if at least one prompt value has not been
#                                  explicitly set via URL parameter, via the API of i-net Crystal-Clear or via the prompt dialog itself.
#                                  Note that this differs from i-net Crystal-Clear behavior former version 7.0 in that default values are not taken as set values.
#
#  TAKE_VALUE_FROM_DEFAULT_VALUES: A prompt dialog is shown every time if and only if at least one prompt value has not been set via URL parameter,
#                                   via the API of i-net Crystal-Clear or via the prompt dialog itself, AND if the prompt has no default value.
#                                   If the prompt has a default value, this value is taken as being "set", and no prompt dialog is shown.
# The default value is VALUES_MUST_BE_EXPLICITLY_SET
PromptBehavior=TAKE_VALUE_FROM_DEFAULT_VALUES


# Specifies if i-net Crystal-Clear has to re-examine the contents of the
# .rpt file (and probably throw away its cached data) each time the
# client sends a new report request (new viewer, new report, ...).
# I-net Crystal-Clear does not throw away its cached data if the user scrolls through the report pages.
# Default is false.
ReloadOnNewRequest=false


# Number of concurrent requests accepted before new requests are denied
MaxConcurrentRequests=10000


# The number of concurrent requests accepted before new requests are queued.
# This is also the number of concurrent running threads.
# Recommended: 5 for a single processor machine (10 for 2 CPU machine, 20 for 4 CPU machine ...)
MaxActiveRequests=5


# This property sets the maximum number of connections for one JDBC url.
# If the maximum number of connections is exceeded and the login timeout is expired,
# a SQLException will be thrown.
# A zero value means unlimited number of connections.
# NOTE:  MAXCONNECTIONS >= n+1 WHERE N IS THE NUMBER OF SUB-REPORTS
# OF THE REPORT TO BE RENDERED.
MaxConnections=150


# The Connection Pool Timeout determines how long a connection will be held in the pool
# before being closed (in minutes). Accessing an open connection is much faster than creating a new one,
# so we suggest a time of at least 10 minutes.
# If you are really low on connections you may reduce this to 1 minute, but performance may degrade.
# A value of 0 will disable the timeout completely, the connections will remain open forever.
# The default value is 10 minutes, zero means unlimited.
ConnectionPoolTimeout=10


# Login timeout for the JDBC drivers in seconds.
LoginTimeout=30


# Query timeout for a statement in seconds.
# The value 0 means there is no limit.
# The default value is 300 seconds = 5 minutes
QueryTimeout=300


# On Error Execute SQL Without SF
# Specifies if the SQL query should be executed without Where clause after an exception has occurred while it has been
# executed with Where clause or if the report execution should be stopped. If the SQL query will be executed without Where clause
# then perhaps a lot of records will be fetched from the database and an OutOfMemoryError can occur.
# The default value is true.
OnError_ExecuteSQL_WithoutSF=true


# ***** MetaData Cache Properties *****
# The MetaData cache stores runtime information about database objects. Usually i-net Crystal-Clear
# will try to identify the database objects of a report when it is executed. That's why some
# JDBC meta data queries will be used. In fact if you request many reports with the same database
# objects or if you request a report many times then for each report meta data queries would be
# needed.
# If you enable the MetaData cache the information about the database objects will be cached  so
# that a second execution of a report would not need a JDBC meta data query anymore.
# Enabling the cache will enhance the speed of the report server.
# The default value is false.
metaDataCache.enabled=true

# If the MetaDataCache is used you can specify a timeout after which the information about a
# database object should be cleared from the cache. If you don't want to set a timeout you can
# set a value of zero. The timeout is specified in minutes.
# The default value (if not specifyed here) is 10 Minutes.
metaDataCache.timeout=10


# Specifies the base file (*.class or *.properties) of the ResourceBundle used for translation of language
# independent labels, parameter field names and parameter field descriptions.
# If this property is set then the engine attempt to replace all labels, parameter field names and
# parameter field descriptions of the report with the values in your ResourceBundle.
# If the name of the default language resource file is: Language.class or Language.properties
# and it is located in the package: MyPackage then the value of the property LanguageResource needs to
# be specified as:
# LanguageResource=MyPackage.Language
# The default language resource file (e.g., Language.properties) should contain the labels for the default
# language (e.g., English). This default language resource file will be used if the language resource file for the
# requested language was not found.
LanguageResource=


# ***** User Defined Formulas *****
# If you want to use "User Defined Formulas" in your reports, you can implements them inside your own classes
# <your class>. To use it with i-net Crystal-Clear you need to add <your class> to the classpath of i-net Crystal-Clear
# and then point the formulaExpanderClass=<your class1>;<your class2> to it.
# Example (assumes that your formulas are inside the classes myTest and myDateFormulas)
# formulaExpanderClass=myTest;myDateFormulas
formulaExpanderClass=


# Specifies a comma separated list of directies or files that will be added to classpath of i-net Crystal-Clear.
# Each specified file of a directory will be added to classpath.
# Use this property to add JDBC drivers, JavaBeans, your own ReportServlet or Database class implementations.
# Files will be added to an own ClassLoader implementation that can be reached in Java with RDC.getClassLoader().
# Examples:
# libDirectory=C:/CrystalClear/libs,C:/jdbcdriverCSv/Fositex.jar,C:/jdbcdriverMSSQL/Merlia.jar,C:/jdbcdriverORACLE/Oranxo.jar,
# libDirectory=C:\\CrystalClear\\libs,C:\\jdbcdriverCSv\\Fositex.jar,C:\\jdbcdriverMSSQL\\Merlia.jar,C:\\jdbcdriverORACLE\\Oranxo.jar
libDirectory=


# ***** Use Client Locale *****
# Most browsers transfer the language of the client to the server.
# If this property is enabled then i-net Crystal-Clear will use this client language for:
#   - Formating of number, date, time and boolean values
#   - the translation of the 'Page N of M', 'Page N' and CrossTab 'Total' labels
#   - the formula functions WeekdayName(), MonthName() and ToWords().
# The default value is true.
useClientLocale=true


# Has Group Tree (enable Drill Down)
# Specifies if the Drill Down feature is enabled/disabled for all reports. If true then the engine creates the data for
# the group tree. The Java viewer applet parameter "HasGroupTree" needs to be true so that the
# Java viewer displays the group tree. With the Java viewer applet parameter "HasGroupTree" you can disable the
# group tree for one report, if the value of the server property hasGroupTree is true.
# The default value is true.
hasGroupTree=true


# ***** Default paper orientation and size *****
# This property will be used when the paper size and/or the paper orientation was not saved in the rpt file.
# This can occur e.g. if the checkbox 'Default Properties' (until Crystal Reports 8.5) or the checkbox
# 'No Printer' was selected in the "Print Setup" dialog box of the Crystal Reports Designer.
#
# The following values are possible:
# default_Orientation=<1|2>
# where:
#       1 - portrait
#       2 - landscape
#
# default_Papersize=<1|2|3|...>
# where:
#       1 - Letter 8 1/2 x 11 in
#       2 - Letter Small 8 1/2 x 11 in
#       3 - Tabloid 11 x 17 in
#       4 - Ledger 17 x 11 in
#       5 - Legal 8 1/2 x 14 in
#       6 - Statement 5 1/2 x 8 1/2 in
#       7 - Executive 7 1/4 x 10 1/2 in

# ...
#
default_Orientation=1
default_PaperSize=1


# The value may be true or false.\u00a0If set to true, then the java
# viewer bean will use real font names. This is useful in an
# environment where all workstations have the same fonts installed. If
# set to false, the java viewer bean will only use abstract font
# names. This is more useful in a setup where different operating
# systems are in use.
UseNativeFonts=false


# This property specifies if the setPageDevice operator will be used for the postscript export or not.
# This is necessary because some printer drivers does not print the .ps file if it contains setPageDevice.
# The default value is true.
UseSetPageDevice=true


# This property specifies if image compression will be used for the postscript export or not.
# This is necessary because some printer drivers does not print the .ps file if it contains compressed images.
# The default value is false.
UseImageCompression=false


# This property specifies that the viewer bean should automatically scale
# the font so that it fits into a given width.
# If you don't want that i-net Crystal-Clear(TM) automatically scales
# the font size then please switch this off.
# The default value is true.
FontAutoScaling=true


# ***** TTF font embedding (PDF, PS export and Java viewer) *****
# Specifies the directory that contains the .ttf and/or .ttc files used for font embedding in PDF export, PS export and Java viewer.
# This value points to the directory containing all TTF fonts that can be embedded
# by i-net Crystal-Clear into the created reports.
# It is recommended to use a font directory which contains all True Type Fonts that you
# would like to embed into your documents, e.g.: C:/CrystalClear/fonts or $HOME/.fonts.
# FontPath=C:/CrystalClear/fonts
# FontPath=$HOME/.fonts
# The default value is empty which means: no TTF fonts available for embedding.
FontPath=/opt/epace/Crystalclear/fonts


# This property specifies the PDF font encoding (code page) for Asian languages that will
# be used from the PDF export if the used font could not be embedded into the PDF file.
# The default value is 936 which is the encoding for simplified Chinese fonts.
# The possible encodings are:
# 932: Japanese
# 936  Simplified Chinese
# 950: Traditional Chinese
PdfAsianFontEncoding=936


# Specifies if the PDF export creates compressed PDF files with a smaller file size.
# The default value is true.
CompressedPDF=true


# Replacement fonts for RTF export
# For RTF export the fonts 'monospaced', 'serif' and 'sansserif' will be replaced through the fonts defined in these properties.
# These fonts are used in rtf export because rtf does not know the symbolic fonts 'monospaced', 'serif' and 'sansserif'.

# SansSerif
# default: Arial
fontmapping.xls.sansserif=Arial
# Monospaced
# default: Courier New
fontmapping.xls.monospaced=Courier New


# Truncate the cell content in excel export
# If it is true then the content of cells will be truncated if it does not fit into the designed field size.
# The value of this "server" property can be changed for a single report with the URL parameter "celltruncate".
# default: true
xls.celltruncate=true


# Font used for text export
# The font need to be a monospaced font.
# The font size need to be specified in points.
# Default:
# txt.fontname=MONOSPACED

# ***** Logging Properties *****
# Log file
# This log file will be used for logging instead of the standard output streams
# (e.g., System.out).
# Use a log file for instance if you use i-net Crystal-Clear as servlet and
# you cannot use the standard output streams for logging.
#log.file=/var/tmp/cc.log
#log.file=C:/CrystalClear/CC.log

#
# 1 ERROR: include error messages such as "report file could not be read;
#          rendering aborted"
#
# 2 WARN : include warning messages such as "font not found, using a
#          replacement font"
#
# 3 INFO : include information messages such as the JDBC driver that i-net

# ***** CCcore files *****
# Enable logging of the database data ("save data of the report
# file").  Please leave this off unless you are asked to switch it on.
# If you switch on logData, then i-net Crystal-Clear(TM) will create a
# file called CCcore<engine-id> in the current directory (or in the
# directory that the parameter coreFile points to).
# You can read back the data with the database
# DatabaseCore (append &dll=core.dll at the end of the request URL).
logData=false

# The path and prefix for cccore files.  Note that if the path does not
# end with a slash, then the last part is treated as a prefix.
# For example c:/cccoreDir/MyCore will dump the data in the directory
# c:/cccoreDir and the files written will have the name MyCore.<report-name>
# Note that even if a cccore file might end with .rpt it is not a
# report file but only the data to be used for the report file.
